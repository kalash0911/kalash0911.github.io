                                    basis? We will start right away by diagnosing the cause of your
                                    problem. Your dental emergency could result from something as
                                    simple as a stuck piece of food that canâ€™t be removed with
                                    floss. We will find it, remove it and disinfect the area.

                                    If your dental emergency consists of an abscess, we can relieve
                                    your pain and, if needed, provide you with antibiotics. This
                                    should improve your tooth pain until you can schedule a regular
                                    office visit for a more complete resolution.

                                    A broken tooth may be able to be repaired and a loosened tooth
                                    can be secured in the jaw so healing can start.

                                    When a person is seen by an emergency dentist quickly enough
                                    after knocking out a tooth, it might be possible to clean that
                                    tooth and restore it to the jaw bone. This action must take
                                    place within 30 minutes.

                                    We have the skills and the facilities to repair your unexpected
                                    injury or dental damage and relieve your pain. Then we can
                                    schedule you for further appointments to complete your
                                    treatment.

                                        twice every year for a complete dental checkup. These
                                        routine visits allow our experts to keep track of your oral
                                        health and to administer timely treatment in the event that
                                        any issues are discovered.
                                        Our dental checkups include a professional teeth cleaning,
                                        digital X-rays when necessary and an oral cancer screening.
                                        Patients are expected to see a dentist every six months for
                                        a checkup to stay healthy.</p>

                                    When you get your teeth cleaned at your dentistâ€™s office, itâ€™s
                                    likely that your hygienist uses hand tools and a sonic cleaner
                                    on all the surfaces of your teeth and then follows this with
                                    polishing. The AIRFLOW system does two steps at once,
                                    incorporating both sonic cleaning and polishing. Completing two
                                    types of cleaning in one step saves you time. You may also find
                                    the AIRFLOW cleaning system more comfortable than earlier types
                                    of dental cleaning youâ€™ve had.
                                    A dental hygienist typically follows AIRFLOW cleaning with
                                    manual cleaning of any tough, hardened spots of calculus.
