                <p class="description">One of the most important steps for maintaining healthy teeth and oral structures is to visit us twice every year for a complete dental checkup. These routine visits allow our experts to keep track of your oral health and to administer timely treatment in the event that any issues are discovered. <br>
                Our dental checkups include a professional teeth cleaning, digital X-rays when necessary and an oral cancer screening. Patients are expected to see a dentist every six months for a checkup to stay healthy.</p>
