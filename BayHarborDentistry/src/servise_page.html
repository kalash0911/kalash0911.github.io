                                        routine visits allow our experts to keep track of your oral

                                        any issues are discovered.
                                        Our dental checkups include a professional teeth cleaning,
                                        digital X-rays when necessary and an oral cancer screening.
                                        Patients are expected to see a dentist every six months for
                                        a checkup to stay healthy.</p>

                                    When you get your teeth cleaned at your dentist’s office, it’s
                                    likely that your hygienist uses hand tools and a sonic cleaner
                                    on all the surfaces of your teeth and then follows this with
                                    polishing. The AIRFLOW system does two steps at once,
                                    incorporating both sonic cleaning and polishing. Completing two
                                    types of cleaning in one step saves you time. You may also find
                                    the AIRFLOW cleaning system more comfortable than earlier types
                                    of dental cleaning you’ve had.
                                    A dental hygienist typically follows AIRFLOW cleaning with
                                    manual cleaning of any tough, hardened spots of calculus.
