                    <h3>How to Deal With Halitosis</h3>
                    <p>To stop bad breath in its tracks, there are several things you can incorporate into your daily routine. Let's take a look at a few.
                        First, make sure to brush your teeth twice a day. Try to use toothpaste that has fluoride and make sure to brush thoroughly along the gum lines and surfaces of your teeth. Make sure to scrub down your tongue as well.
                        Try to floss once a day to get rid of any food or other materials that are caught in your teeth. It's important to note that most mouthwash products don't have a long-lasting effect on halitosis. When you use it, try to keep it in your mouth for at least 30 seconds before spitting it out.
                        Incorporate more fruits and vegetables into your daily diet. At the same time, try to avoid any foods that are known to cause bad breath. These include onions, garlic, and other spicy foods.
                        You should also avoid alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, both of which can contribute to bad breath.
                        If you wear dentures that are removable, make sure to take them out every night.
                        And lastly, make sure to get dental care at least twice a year to have them cleaned and scaled!
