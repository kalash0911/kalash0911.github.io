                            <p>Kroma.ai, formerly known as SlideShop, offers an AI-based platform to create on-point pitches, proposals, and presentations that win. Presentations are brought to life through their data visualization tools, expert-created decks, and proprietary grab-and-go content. The company was still known as SlideShop when I first met with their leadership team. I partnered with this SaaS startup to support the transition from SlideShop to Kroma.ai, an AI-enabled presentation platform, and help them raise the second round of funding.</p>

The goal was to identify and gain market opportunity while building a successful brand and stimulating business growth.</p>
                            <h3>Solutions</h3>
                            <p>Competitive intelligence clearly indicated that the market opportunity for Kroma.ai was in the startup space.

                            <p>Why Kroma.ai? The word chroma means the purity of a color. We transformed chroma into Kroma.ai—“ai” being a nod to our platform’s artificial intelligence features.
                            Brand colors & imagery: Kroma.ai was envisioned as a playful brand with an intelligent tone of voice. We used the color purple to represent intuition and persuasion. Vibrant colors—like pink and yellow—popped on contrasting backgrounds, emphasizing the creativity of the brand. We used images of diverse business professionals and technology props to create a personalized experience for Kroma.ai’s target audience.
                            The font: Sofia Bold Pro was the perfect font choice. It has a professional feel to it, yet it also evokes warmth and friendliness.
                            Brand narrative: The brand narrative focused on automated inspiration. The automated inspiration was a result of Kroma.ai’s AI-based platform that empowered users to perfect content and design, visualize data, and consequently transform their big ideas into winning presentations.</p>
