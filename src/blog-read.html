                                    <p class="paragraph1">One of the most frequently asked questions to digital specialists is: “What is a good or a bad website?”. The answer is very simple - a good website is the one which is fully delivering the result which you planned on it. If you have a website for the restaurant, then maybe your idea is that the website presents your restaurant in the best light. Maybe additionally having a clear way to make a reservation, or have a possibility to order a delivery and pay online. If you have a B2C (products or services), then you might have an idea that your website generates more clients, and you use the website as a clear place with all needed information + CTA function and etc.</p>
                                    <p class="paragraph2">But this is not difficult to achieve, right? Then why don`t you get expected results from your website? Why does no one write to you (except spam emails) or order your services or products? Our team wondered about this question and found a way to explain it with simple words.</p>

                                    <p class="paragraph1">There are 3 most important moments to look at: - Visual Presentation (design/ general look) - Technical Performance (mistakes in the code) - SEO (search engine optimization, problems with google recognition or simply there is no marketing to know that your website actually exists).</p>
                                    <p class="paragraph2">Based on this research we have created a special tool “Krock Signature Web Assessment”, which can show to any website owner a clear answer on his own website`s performance. It is a simple graphic with 6 different zones for ranking the website, from Dead Zone (website=picture on the wall) to High Competitive. The graphic is based on 2 vectors (vertical = Visual Performance; horizontal = Technical Performance + SEO).</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <div class="blog-text-item item3">
                                <div class="blog-text">
                                    <p class="paragraph1">Both Criteria Subjects include 20 different sub-criteria that ranks your website and brings it to one of the zones of the graphic. So simple and clear it is! As a result, everyone could see, what are the strong parts of the website, what are the weak parts, and getting an answer to another very important question…” Is my website good enough to deliver the right result?" With this assessment website owners can get clear about their website, take it under control, and start to get a better profit from it.</p>

From our side, we would provide a document with graphic-assessment and explanation within the next 24h (our work times from Monday to Friday, from 9 am - 5 pm UTC +2).</p>
